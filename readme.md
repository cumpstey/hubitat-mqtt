# Hubitat MQTT Link

Builds on a version by [mydevbox](https://github.com/mydevbox/hubitat-mqtt-link), with the following major changes (and some other less major changes):

- Allows the name of the device to be changed without the selected capabilities being reset.
- Generates device config for Home Assistant. For the kinds of devices which I own - not a complete list.
